1. Find a collection from a code base your have experienced.
2. Look at various possibilities of using functional interfaces with generics
3. Try using Consumer, Function and Predicate functional interfaces

```java

public class CountryData {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String [] countries = new String[] {"Singapore, India,Japan, Russia, Netherlands, Ukraine","France", "Italy"};
